## About Project

### Issue
Tweaking resumes and cover letters take too long for each new job.

### Proposed solution
An AI-powered service that dynamically updates Resumes with relevant skills and phrasing based on given job descriptions and candidate skills.

### Optics
Similar products exist already, but they require payments and they are not open-source, thus, they are not guarantees of privacy of sensitive information

### Languages/Framekworks/Technologies (thus far + anticipated)
1. Python/TypeScript
2. Parcel Front End (might actually switch to Vite for TS enforcement)
3. So far, no formal Back End framework
3a. could implement a Django framework once backend APIs required for Front End communication

4. Currently choosing betwen AWS and Vercel. AWS is expensive but I want to learn deploying with it.
AWS Cloud Deployment. Some of these services may or may not be implemented, depending on traffic:
4a. EC2
4b. S3
4c. CloudFront
4d. Route 53
4e. Auto-scaling
4f. Elastic Load Balancer

### Other Misc Notes
1. Can't find any reasons to add anything related to DBs to this project. this could just be lambda-executions on AWS or something
