# ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
## Nothing done here yet. End goal:
### Create GUI that can:
1. Display Uploaded Resume (file type support: doc/docx, txt, pdf, and .tex)
2. User highlights section => these become field placeholders for LLM modifications
3. Render highlighted sections with substituted recommended LLM modification outputs
4. Keep sensitive information section local in browser and sub those in as well- can also be highlighting mechanism, so I guess we'll need TWO different highlighters
5. Have download feature for modified Resume
